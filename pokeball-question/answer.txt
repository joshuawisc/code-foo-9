According to Bulbapedia(1) the size of a Pokeball switches between that of a baseball or a ping pong ball by pressing a button. My calculations will be under the assumption that the pokeballs are full sized

Diameter of Pokeball = 75mm in diameter (2)
Vol of Pokeball =  2.21 * 10^-4 cub m

Height of Coit Tower = 64 m (3)
Diameter ~= 11m measured from Google Maps

Vol of Tower = 6082.12 cub m

The Pokeballs are packed in a HCP lattice to produce highest average density of 74% of total volume (4)

74% of Vol of Tower = 0.74 * 6082.12 = 4500.77 cub m

Amount of Pokeballs = Total volume occupied by balls / Vol per ball
                    = 4500.77 / 2.21 * 10^-4 cub m
                    = 20,365,475 Pokeballs
